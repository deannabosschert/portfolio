Users can find their own healthcare institution or an institution of interest and can shop with the profit they made in a specific year. Users can buy silly things in the webshop like a private jet or an Aston Martin supercar.</p></header><section class="project__description"><article class=""><h2>Description</h2><p>Datavisualizations show how a company&#39;s profit compares to the &#39;normal&#39; amount, and are presented in both data(visualisations) and comparable luxury goods to illustrate how large these can get.</p><p>Users can find their own Dutch healthcare institution or an institution of interest and can shop with the profit they made in a specific year. Users can buy silly things in the webshop like a private jet or an Aston Martin supercar, which shows how excessive some amounts of profit can be. At checkout, they receive a receipt stating what other, actual healthcare products could&#39;ve been bought with that money.</p><p>At the stats page users can then dive into the numbers and identify the zorgcowboys. They see how the chosen healthcare institution compares to the rest of the dataset; Netherlands in general, and to the norm (&#39;from what range can we find this institution suspicious?&#39;). This way, with some explanation about what a zorgcowboy is, they can identify if their chosen healthcare institution is one.</p><p>This was my first &#39;real&#39; team-project; working with 2 great designers and an amazing developer in such an organized workflow, was really good. We worked with Vue and Nuxt to build it, and I&#39;ve made the charts using ChartsJS. I&#39;m still proud of how the project turned out, I enjoyed the collaboration also very much and have also learned lots during.</p></article><article class="project__tech"><h2>Technologies</h2><p>Used technologies</p><ul><li>HTML</li><li>Semantics</li></ul><ul><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li></ul><ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>Client-side</li><li>Server-side</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Vue.js</li><li>Nuxt.js</li><li>Liquid</li><li>Chart.js</li></ul></article></section><section class="project__links"><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a class="" href="https://pointer-project.netlify.app/">site</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://github.com/deannabosschert/pointer-project">repo</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Design-Rationale--BepS9NirWXzwQvE32CVkzpBtAQ-gMkTYJUu7zUybJ3wlmf4hs">documentation</a></li></ul></section></main><footer class="c-footer"></footer></body></html>
