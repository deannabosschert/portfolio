Using Headless CMS Storyblok, students and teachers can create custom components and pages. Along with this, a handbook for onboarding new collaborators which explains how this new CMS and website works.</p><p>PWA team project, data managed by a headless CMS. Allows non-tech-y text-writers, developers, students and other collaborators to contribute to this environment that contains (in-depth) information about Communication and Multimedia Design.</p><p>The final assignment of the minor Web Development, built by a 3-man team. This was my first time using Eleventy in a project, and working with a Headless CMS. Data is pulled from the CMS and put into a logical structure of cleaning, assigning and rendering, and then rolled out as a static site. It was mostly an assignment about making a proof of concept for integration with a headless CMS. It&#39;s super interesting and the features of the CMS are still evolving, and ever since I&#39;ve been wanting to work more with it. Therefore this portfolio&#39;s project content is also linked with Storyblok :)</p></article><article class="project__tech"><h2>Technologies</h2><p>Used technologies</p><ul><li>HTML</li><li>Semantics</li></ul><ul><li>CSS</li></ul><ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>Client-side</li><li>Server-side</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Nuxt.js</li><li>Storybook</li><li>Storyblok</li><li>Headless CMS</li><li>Liquid</li><li>Eleventy SSG</li></ul></article></section><section class="project__links"><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a class="" href="https://cmd-digital-playground.now.sh">site</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://github.com/deannabosschert/meesterproef-1920">repo</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://cmd-digital-playground.gitbook.io/design-rationale-cmd-digital-playground/">documentation</a></li></ul></section></main><footer class="c-footer"></footer></body></html>
