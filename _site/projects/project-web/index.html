Travelling photographers can view, rate and annotate their pictures using their phone.</p><p>UX prototype of an interactive concept that&#39;s based on real-life data and media context of the user.</p><p>As the concept felt useful for own use as well, I&#39;d chosen to work with actual data instead of just a design and developed this prototype. I&#39;ve used Flickr&#39;s and Unsplash&#39; REST-API for fetching photographs, SCSS for styling and made use of Eleventy to generate a static site.</p><p>When you&#39;re on vacation and don&#39;t have much time sorting out and rating your pictures in Lightroom every night, you can use picture.this to help you out. Upload your photos to a Flickr album once you&#39;re in your hotel, and then during the day, you can use this website to scroll through your photos and rate them or leave comments. Spread out this chore over the vacation whenever you have a moment on your phone!</p><p>Photo&#39;s you&#39;ve uploaded to Flickr are displayed below chronologically, starting from the first day of the trip. Scroll through the pics, give them a rating and add some comments.</p><p>You can also gain some visual inspiration by entering a topic you&#39;ll encounter on your way today, and get a nice mood board of that topic out of the Unsplash and Pinterest API.</p><p>You can also stash a few annotations of experiences on this trip that you&#39;d like to remember afterwards, on the site. These will come in handy once you get home when making descriptions per photo collection, or when making a photo book.</p></article><article class="project__tech"><h2>Technologies</h2><p>Used technologies</p><ul><li>HTML</li><li>A11y</li></ul><ul><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li></ul><ul><li>JavaScript</li><li>Client-side</li><li>Server-side</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Eleventy SSG</li><li>API</li></ul></article></section><section class="project__links"><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a class="" href="https://project-web-2021.netlify.app/">site</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://github.com/deannabosschert/project-web">repo</a></li><li><a class="" href="https://deanna-bosschert-1.gitbook.io/project-web/">documentation</a></li></ul></section></main><footer class="c-footer"></footer></body></html>
