    <h1>Skills, tech and tools</h1>
    <p>During my studies I learned a lot about different tech, tools and soft skills.</p>
    <p>I started learning HTML in high school, but I only really got into it at my bachelor's.
        In the first year of my studies, I learned how to create a simple webpage with HTML and CSS.
        From the second year on, JavaScript was added to the stack, and Node.js with it.</p>
    <p>So, I started to learn basic HTML/CSS in high school but I didn't do much with it until I started my bachelor's.
        I did two courses on HTML/CSS/JS the first year, in the second year started with the more advanced things and
        then in the last semester, decided to follow 'Project Tech' in which we got to learn Node.JS and more advanced
        front-end JS. Third year, I've followed both the semester project Emerging Technologies and Information Design.
        I realized I rather wanted to focus on developing datavisualizations with d3.js, learning a framework and
        writing code using functional programming principles.</p>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>During the first year of following the Minor Webdevelopment at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences,
            we took a deep dive into HTML and how the usage of correct semantics and structure helps to create a better
            user experience, more sustainable fundament and improves the accessibility of a website.</p>
        <p> Since then, I've been trying to make use of the best practices of HTML & CSS and consistently use MDN/W3C as
            primary reference. Because I've put in time to learn more about the different ways of writing HTML, I've
            been able to write more semantic HTML and more readable code. Somewhere between then and now, I got into
            teaching others how to write semantic HTML and to make sure it doesn't contain ye olde div-garbage belt for
            no reason.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>As for CSS; I now mostly use SCSS as a pre-processor and make use of my personal folder-stucture for the
            different files, but I'm open to learn another way kind of structure or pre-processor.</p>

    <section id="chapter__collaboration" class="chapter chapter__collaboration">
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>During my study and internships, collaboration was a key part of my learning. I've been working with other
            students, with teachers, other developers and in multidisciplinary teams.</p>
        <p>The most important thing in this is not only how to use the tools like git and GitHub/Lab, but also just how
            to
            work with other people and how to make sure that we could understand each other's code. Collaboration was
            mostly
            done via GitHub and making use of their tools like project boards, branches, issues, pull requests, etc.</p>

    <section id="chapter__design" class="chapter chapter__design">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>As Communication & Multimedia Design is mostly a design-focused study, I also have a degree in UX-design and
            am
            very comfortable with multidisciplinary collaboration.</p>
        <p>As I was specializing in development and therefore focusing on the development side of things, my visual
            design
            skills haven't been that strong. In the past year I've decided I wanted to improve those as well, so I put
            in
            time to learn more about visual design. With my internship and then graduation project this was one of the
            challenges I wanted to tackle.
            With putting in enough effort, I'm proud to have managed to deliver a product with decent appearance as well
            and
            am now very comfortable with the design process beginning to end.</p>

    <section id="chapter__teaching" class="chapter chapter__teaching">
        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, I've gotten into teaching by working as a teaching assistent for the course Computer
            Science
            at a high school. I did this for 2 years, then quit so I could focus on my study and also do a board year at
            our
            study society. After this board year, I picked up teaching again as a student assistant at the Amsterdam
            University of Applied Sciences. I did this at my own bachelor's and mostly the first- and second year
            students
            in tech-related courses.</p>
        <p>Some courses I assisted at:
            <ul>
                <li>Internet standards</li>
                <li>Introduction Programming</li>
                <li>Frontend Development</li>
                <li>Project Tech (frontend/backend)</li>
                <li>Guest lecture at Infomation Design Tech Track about writing documentation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I've also given an introduction course for first-year's in HTML/CSS and set up the 2-week course myself.</p>

    <section id="chapter__documentation" class="chapter chapter__documentation">
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>Whereas most people don't really like spending time writing documentation, I'm actually quite fond of it</p>
        <p>Once you've developed a few basic templates for different purposes, it's mostly just a checklist with gaps to
            fill in and becomes less and less work to keep doing.</p>
        <p>So, since the minor webdevelopment in the second round I've been working on a documentation system for my own
            projects. This baseline has been iterated and used over lots of other school assignments over the past two
            years and been expanded with useful information.</p>
        <p>This has been done in GitBook, GitHub Wiki, Readme, Notion, you name it.</p>
        <p>To top it off, my graduation project was also mainly focused on project documentation and its influence on
            efficiency and collaboration.</p>
