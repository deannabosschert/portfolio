<!-- In the past few years I've learned the importance of keeping documentation. Therefore I tried to put in some extra effort with every project to iterate my documenting skills. -->

<!-- <p>With every project, a minimum of documentation has to be done. 3 years ago, I decided to standardize this a bit. I
    made a basic template to use for readme's in school projects, and later added the Wiki to it too.

    These were mostly educational/learning/evaluation focused but I tried improving with each project.

    Finally, my last project (thesis) was a documentation tool in itself.

<!-- Project documentation tool for designers & developers and guideline to the best practices for building and deploying webapplications.  -->

<!-- Lots of it is in Dutch instead of English; most of it was written as part of school assignments so I sometimes went
    for the quickest way to write a lot of content. Another thing that might stand out is that it's not written with
    any desire to be professional. Of course, in projects with clients I'd write professional language only, but in this
    particular learning environment I chose not to in order to express myself better.  -->
