        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>Hi! üëãüèº I'm Deanna, digital designer and front-end webdeveloper.</p>
        <p>Currently in my last year of studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of
          Applied Sciences. During my study, I've chosen to follow all the tech-related courses. My main focus lies on
          Web Design and Development, using mostly JavaScript. Over the past few years I've been working on quite a few
          projects, the ones that display my current skills best are showcased below.</p>
        <p>Or, of course, just visit my <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
            href="https://github.com/deannabosschert">GitHub</a> directly for some
          insights of my programming ways and a look into my resume.</p>
        <!-- <p>Because i've been wandering the tech-track of Communication and Multimedia Design, I've worked on lots of
        tech-related projects. Below are a few of those.</p> -->

            programming principles.</p>
          <p>This project's focus is on data manipulation; a large 'dirty' dataset is server-side cleaned by using
            functional programming patterns in ES6. Then, the data is put into usable elements, some nice styling added
            and then using Eleventy converted to a cool, visual overview.</p>

          <p>As the concept felt useful for own use as well, I'd chosen to work with actual data instead of just a
            design and developed this prototype. I've used Flickr's and Unsplash' REST-API for fetching photographs,
            SCSS for styling and made use of
            Eleventy to generate a static site.</p>

            code. I've paid lots of attention to the responsiveness of the site, and even though the pictures and style
            guide were a bit horrible to work with, it turned out to be a good exercise.</p>

            of cleaning, assigning and rendering, and then rolled out as a static site. It was mostly an assignment
            about making a proof of concept for integration with a headless CMS. It's super interesting and the features
            of the CMS are still evolving, so I'd like to re-open this project sometime actually.</p>

          <p>In this project, the set-up of a client-side web app is made. Data is fetched by making async requests to a
            REST-API (in this case GitHub), modified by using manipulation methods like map/filter/reduce, and then
            dynamically converted to HTML-elements using templating. I've made use of things like LocalStorage,
            transparency.js (template engine), routie.js (routing), and have implemented some additional states like
            loading animations and skeletonUI-animations to keep the user involved.</p>

          <p>During the minor Web Development, I've spent lots of time in college and received lots of super interesting
            lectures. Some by our own teachers, some by people from partner companies. I've been sketchnoting the key
            takeaways of these talks and wanted to display them in a cool way so I made this digital flipthrough-book.
            I've also written three articles about being a designer, being a programmer and a 'how to-' about atomic
            design. These are displayed below the book.</p>

        <h2>Illustrations</h2>
        <p>Illustrating is cool. By no means I'm a visual designer but besides writing code, I do really enjoy working
          on my illustration/design
          skills. Here's a few things that I drew in the past year.</p>
