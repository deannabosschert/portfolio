      <h3>let me introduce myself.</h3>
      <p>Hi! üëãüèº I'm Deanna, digital designer and front-end webdeveloper.</p>
      <p>Currently in my last year of studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. During my study, I've chosen to follow all the tech-related courses. My main focus lies on Web Design and Development, using mostly JavaScript. Over the past few years I've been working on quite a few projects, the ones that display my current skills best are showcased below.</p>
      <p>Or, of course, just visit my <a href="https://github.com/deannabosschert">GitHub</a> directly for some insights of my programming ways.</p>
      <!-- <p>Because i've been wandering the tech-track of Communication and Multimedia Design, I've worked on lots of
        tech-related projects. Below are a few of those.</p> -->
